# Network Requests

Using async and await ,implement the necessary code to recover the Todos list present in the following URL through an http request: [link](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) . Subsequently, dynamically create a list of elements `<li>` containing the Todo title (title property in the collection of objects returned by the Response) and append it to the '.todo-list' element.
N.B: The Body of the Response contains the Todos list in Json format, use the .json method present in the response to perform the deserialization.
